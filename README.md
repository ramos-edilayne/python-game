# python-game
This work utilizes the PyGame library (Python equivalent to C/C++'s SDL) to develop system logic and manipulate events, focusing on object collision. The project involves a simple evasion game: the player controls a block with directional keys to avoid colliding with enemies. This concept mirrors a spaceship dodging asteroids.
  
  📝 This project was developed during my first semester at the university. It was my initial exposure to game-oriented programming. Although it is a simple project, it provided me with a highly significant learning experience in this field.
  
  📌 The primary objective of this work is to provide an experience in system development utilizing a library with various available functionalities, to develop the logic for a simple game, and to detect and manipulate game events (such as the collision between objects).
  
  The context of the proposed game involves the player controlling a block (via the directional keys on the keyboard) that must dodge enemies, thereby avoiding collision.
