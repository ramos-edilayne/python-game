# python-game
This work utilizes the PyGame library (Python equivalent to C/C++'s SDL) to develop system logic and manipulate events, focusing on object collision. The project involves a simple evasion game: the player controls a block with directional keys to avoid colliding with enemies. This concept mirrors a spaceship dodging asteroids.
